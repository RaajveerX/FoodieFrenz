Innovative Idea: 
In our application, we will be filtering through fast food restaurants. It would contain various fast food chains that exist in the United States and the user would be able to filter out restaurants based off of food restrictions, location, specific foods, and more. The application would provide a ranking of the best restaurants according to the filters chosen. It also has an option where it specifies the menu available according to your filters and lists out information about the food. Our application is similar to Yelp, however, it focuses on fast food specifically and provides more details on menus according to filters.


Data: 
Some of the data types that we will include are:
- restaurant name: this will include the names of fast food restaurants
- locations: this would contain the various locations that a specific fast food restaurant is located in
- customer reviews: for each restaurant, there is an option for users to leave reviews and this would be a collection of reviews that have been made
- rating: this will be an important part of the project because it will contain the rank of the restaurant in comparison to the others that exist
- restaurant menu: this will contain all the food options that the fast food restaurants provide
- menu ingredients: this will list all of the ingredients for every item in the menu for each of the restaurants
- food allergens: this will contain common food allergens for each item in the menu so users can easily filter
- food images: this will contain images of menu items at each restaurant
- delivery times: this will give an estimate of the average delivery times for each restaurant
- restaurant sites: this will provide an easy to access link to the restaurants main page in case the user wants to order food from there or view additional information
- food categories: this will be a tag to represent the kind of food that is offered at the restaurant
- popular items: this will recommend the most popular menu items at each restaurant 

Functionality: 
In our web application, the main functionality we will be implementing is a filtering and discovery system, which will allow the user to search through our created database of restaurants/foods according to different criteria, such as food allergies and ratings. It will also allows user to find new items and view them in more detail, such as nutritional information of foods that are chosen. 

One of our other types of functionalities we will be including is a system where users can create their own profiles and sign-in, allowing for more personalization based on their needs. With this, we will allow users to apply their own specific preferences, such as dietary needs, or allergies. Then, the data will be processed through the app in order to provide a personalized meal to their needs (whether it is a meal for the day, or weekly, etc). For example, users who indicate they do not consume meat through the app will be recommended a solely vegetarian diet.  

The third functionality allows users to leave new reviews on restaurants and specfic food items. Users will provide a numerical rating, any comments or description, and an optional photo. Reviews can be viewed by other users. Users' ratings will be used to recalculate a restaurant's/food's overall rating.

Next, users will be able to create their own ranking and tier lists of restaurants or specific food items. Multiple rankings can be created and saved to a user's account. Users will be able to share their rankings to friends and other users.

Another functionality will be a map functionality where users will be able to see locations of specific restaurants that are close to them or a specific zipcode that they enter. 

Lastly, there will be an email functionality where users will get weekly recommendations and activity from the web application directly to their email so that they get reminders to check and continue ranking and filtering through places. The email can also give recommendations for new menu items and restaurant recommendations.
